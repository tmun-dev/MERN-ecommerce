**Projects were made on a separate private repository that I use for clients**
Goal of the project was to create a custom ecommerce site that connects a stripe to a database that can also be controlled by a **telegram bot**
Watch sellers often use private telegrams for their client, the goal was to create a way to control their website stock list via this telegram chat, without the need to upload watches on both the website and their telegram.

You will also find the code for the telegram bot on this github
